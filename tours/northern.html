<div class="tour_program_content">Chinggis Khaan international airport --> Hotel --> Gandan Monastery --> Bogd khan museum --> Chinggis Square --> Mongolian Nomadic Restaurant --> Hotel.</div>
<div class="tour_program_place">Gandan Monastery</div>
<div class="tour_program_content">It is the largest and most significant monastery in Mongolia. The first temple of the monastery was built in 1809 and moved to the present location in 1838. Over the next century the monastery grew to include nine institutes, a library and housed around 5000 monks. Gandan became an important center for learning and practicing Buddha’s teachings in Mongolia. 
<br>In 1938, communism spread out in Mongolia, around 900 monasteries were destroyed and turned into museums. The monks were killed, jailed or forced to join the army.
In 1944, after a petition from several monks, Gandan Monastery was reopened but its functions were carried out under the strict supervision of the socialist government.
In 1990, after Democracy and with Buddhism flourishing once more, Gandan Monastery embarked on an ambitious restoration program around the country. There are currently 10 temples operating at Gandan monastery and approximately 900 monks.
</div>
<div class="tour_program_place">National History Museum of Mongolia</div>
<div class="tour_program_content">It is a cultural, scientific, and educational organization, which is responsible for the collection, conservation and interpretation of the objects under its curation.
The first museum in Mongolia, which was called the Mongolian National Museum was established in 1924. Russian scholars, such as Pyotr Kozlov, V. I. Lisovskii, A. D. Simukov, and the American researcher Roy Chapman Andrews contributed to the museum's early collections and exhibits.
<br>The modern National Museum of Mongolian History was established after the merger of the historical, archaeological and ethnographical departments of the State Central Museum and the Museum of the Revolution in 1991. It is now located in a facility built for the Museum of the Revolution, which was founded in 1971. 
The National Museum of Mongolia is currently recognized as one of the leading museums in Mongolia. Exhibitions cover prehistory, pre-Mongol Empire history, Mongol Empire, Mongolia during Qing rule, ethnography and traditional life, and twentieth-century history. The ethnographic collection has significant displays of the traditional dress of various Mongolian ethnic groups and of snuff bottles. 
<br>Most exhibits have labels in both Mongolian and English.
</div>
<div class="tour_program_place">Chinggis Square </div>
<div class="tour_program_content">In July 1921 in the centre of Ulaanbaatar, the ‘hero of the revolution’, Damdin Sükhbaatar, declared Mongolia’s final independence from the Chinese. The square now features a bronze statue of Sükhbaatar astride his horse. In 2013 the city authorities changed the name from Sükhbaatar Square to Chinggis Khaan Square, although many citizens still refer to it by the old name.
<br>Peaceful anti-communism protests were held here in 1990, which eventually ushered in the era of democracy. Today, the square (talbai ) is occasionally used for rallies, ceremonies and rock concerts and festivals, but is generally a relaxed place where kiddies drive toy cars and teens whiz around on bikes. Behind the Chinggis monument stands Parliament House , which is commonly known as Government House. An inner courtyard of the building holds a large ceremonial ger used for hosting visiting dignitaries.

<div class="tour_program_title">Day 2</div>
<div class="tour_program_place">Amarbayasgalant Monastery</div> <a>(Translates as “peaceful happiness”)</a>
<div class="tour_program_content">Amarbayasgalant Khiid or the Monastery of Tranquil Felicity - once one of the three largest Buddhist institutions in Mongolia is located near the Selenge river in the Iven river valley, at the foot of Mount Buren-Khaan in Baruuburen soum of Selenge province in northern Mongolia. Looking for a site for building, the exploratory group met a boy and a girl, Amar and Bayasgalant, playing in a steppe, and decided to build the future monastery at that site and name the monastery after those children. The Amarbayasgalant Monastery was built to honor the memory of theocratic leader G.Zanabazar, by order Manchu Emperor Enkh-Amgalan Khan (Yongzheng).
<br>The Monastery was built between 1726 and 1737 using imported craftsmen; the overall style is Chinese, despite some Mongol and Tibetan influence. The monastery is certainly different and more unitary than any other in Mongolia. The main temple was constructed without single iron nail and all based on wooden block puzzles. Surrounded by a wall, the buildings are set in a north-south axis around the main two-storey Tsogchin Dugan, or main temple. Pavilions, courtyard and smaller temples are set methodically around the grounds. By the early 1890s, Amarbayasgalant was one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Mongolia. In the early 1900s, over 8,000 monks lived at the monastery. 
<br>During the anti-Buddhist purges of the 1930s, many of Amarbayasgalant’s temples were ransacked of their relics and several buildings destroyed. But the main temple complex was not destroyed and restoration work began in 1988 and some of the new deities were commissioned in Delhi, India. Finally reopened as a fully functioning monastery in 1991. The pilgrims have returned and the monastery is again the site of important Buddhist gatherings.
</div>
<div class="tour_program_place">Darkhan City</div>
<div class="tour_program_content">Darkhan is the second largest city in Mongolia and the capital of Darkhan-Uul Aimag(Darkhan-Uul Province). It had a population of 180,738 in 2010. 
On October 17, 1961, the city of Darkhan was built with extensive economic assistance from the Soviet Union. As its name implies, the city was originally conceived to be a manufacturing site for Mongolia's northern territory. The city remains a mostly industrial region and is the home of some 82% of Darkhan-Uul Province's population. As with most urban Mongols, some 86% of the city's population live in residential apartments, with the remaining population living in yurts (gers) on the outskirts of the city. The city is relatively close to Russia and retains a fairly small percentage of native Russians.
<br>Darkhan has a borderline humid continental climate, close to the more typical subarctic climate of northern Mongolia, which is found in higher areas near the city, and only marginally wet enough to avoid qualifying as a semi-arid climate. These three climate types tend to overlap a good deal over the border regions of Mongolia, Russia and Kazakhstan.  This area has extremely cold and dry winters; however the summers are warmer and more humid.

</div>
<div class="tour_program_place">Erdenet City</div>
<div class="tour_program_content">Erdenet is the third-largest city in Mongolia and the capital of the aimag(province) of Orkhon. Officially known as Bayan-Undur sum. Located in the northern part of the country, it lies in a valley between the Selenge and Orkhon rivers about 150 miles (241 kilometres) northwest of Ulaanbaatar, the capital. The road length between Ulaanbaatar and Erdenet is about 230 mi (370 km).
<br>Erdenet, one of the youngest settlements in Mongolia, was founded in 1974 in an area where large deposits of copper had been discovered in the 1950s. A single-track railway line with a length of 75 mi (121 km) linking Erdenet to the Trans-Mongolian Railway was inaugurated in 1977. In the middle of the 1980s, more than 50% of the inhabitants were Russians working as engineers or miners. After the fall of Soviet Communism in 1990, however, most Russians left Erdenet. Today about 10% of the population is Russian.
<br>The city hosts the fourth largest copper mine in the world. The "Erdenet Mining Corporation" is a joint Mongolian-Russian venture, and accounts for a majority of Mongolia's hard currency income. Erdenet mines 22.23 million tons of ore per year, producing 126,700 tons of copper and 1,954 tons of molybdenum. The mine accounts for 13.5% of Mongolia's GDP and 7% of tax revenue. About 8,000 people are employed in the mine.
<br>The city of Erdenet offers a large variety of shops, has a comparatively large hospital, a Sports Palace, several hotels and restaurants.

<div class="tour_program_content">Murun is the administrative center of Khuvsgul Aimag (province) in northern Mongolia. Before 1933, Khatgal had been the Aimag capital.
Although a poorly developed town, Murun has a hospital, a museum, a theatre, a post office, several schools and kindergartens, like any other provincial capitals of Mongolia. Additionally, it was connected to the Mongolian central power grid in 2004.

	<br>More than that, Murun is known as its famous Lake Khuvsgul, 136 km long and 36 km wide, at 1645 metres above sea level, is the second largest lake in Mongolia as well as the deepest. Known as the Blue Pearl of Mongolia, because of it’s crystal clear waters, it flows into Eg River, which then joins the Selenge, and finally reaches lake Baikal.
Almost 70 percent of Khovsgol lake is over 100 metres deep, reaching 267 metres at its deepest point. This is the largest reservoir of freash water in the country and represents two percent of the world’s reserves. Such is the clarity of the water that one can see fish down to a depth of a few dozen metres. From January to April or May, the lake freezes over and covered for several months by 1.5 metres of ice. Lorries used to drive across it in winter, a practice banned since the 1980s to prevent pollution.
<br>In the centre of the lake are four islands known as the “Earth Navel”, “Stone navel”, the “Wood navel” and the “Small navel”. Around the lake are a number of caves. Brown bear, musk deer, ibex, argali, marten. Beavers, elk, lynx and wolves inhabit the surrounding mountains.

<div class="tour_program_content">The freshwater Terkhiin Tsagaan Nuur is not as forested or as large as Khövsgöl Nuur, but it is closer to Ulaanbaatar, relatively undeveloped and just about perfect for camping (though there are a few flies in summer). The lake, birdlife and mountains are now protected within the 77,267-hectare Khorgo-Terkhiin Tsagaan Nuur National Park .
According to legend, the lake was formed when an elderly couple forgot to cap a well after fetching water. The valley was flooded until a local hero shot a nearby mountain top with his arrow; the shorn top covered the well and became an island in the lake (Noriin Dund Tolgoi). Another theory is that it was formed by lava flows from a volcanic eruption many millennia ago.
The lake is around 16km long, east to west, and around 4km to 6km wide, north to south. It takes around two hours to walk from Tariat to the northeast corner of the lake (6km). Here you'll find the largest concentration of ger camps, plus some shops selling drinks, snacks, cooking provisions and even gas cannisters for camping stoves. Most of the rest of the ger camps and the best camping spots are then strung out along the northern lakeshore.
